#+begin_abstract
Evaluating stress is a challenging task, given the complexity and the different
approaches that can be used. In this paper we provide a software inspired by the
MIST protocol, which aims to automate the process and make it smoother for the
researcher. Here we focus on a user experience and usability study with the
support of the AttrakDiff system that aims to evaluate how easy and appealing it
is. The output will be used for future iterations of the design process.

* Introduction
** COMMENT Description
*** What is it about?
The introduction describes the problem you solved and why it is important. You
start with a general problem definition and subsequently a more detailed
description of the problem you faced. Then, you provide existing solutions to
this problem or related problems and their solution. Make sure the reader
understands the differences! You HAVE to use references in this section to
provide an idea what has already been done in this research area. Mainly, you
cite journal articles [[cite:big]], conference proceedings
[[cite:PMID:21522225]] books [[cite:theodoridis_pattern_2009]] and web links
[[cite:noauthor_longman_nodate]] Having defined the body of knowledge you
introduce how you are going to solve the problem. You finish with a crystal
clear purpose of your project or contribution to the problem.

The literature review is written in simple past. The rest of the introduction is
generally present tense. You can also use present tense for giving insight in
what will be shown in the article. A rule of thumb are six references of other
solutions or related projects, solutions and systems.

** Stress test background :ignore:
Stress is one of the key actors in our society today. If it goes above a certain
threshold, it could bring adverse effects to a person's health
cite:mcewen_stress_1998. This explains why it is important to understand the
physiological mechanisms that relate stress to illness.

\\

** Existing solutions for testing stress :ignore:

To investigate stress in the laboratory, researchers have established paradigms,
such as the Trier Social Stress Test, focused on public speaking and mental
arithmetic and the Trier Mental Challenge Test (TMCT), with computerized mental
arithmetic and negative feedback. To evaluate how stress activates the brain in
an imaging environment, the Montreal Imaging Stress Test (MIST) protocol was
developed, using the TMCT as a basis cite:dedovic_montreal_2005.

The MIST approach takes a step forward in terms of reproducibility, since it
provides a software that keeps a record of the performance of the user in the
arithmetic test and it is adapted to produce social stress in an interactive
setting, where the test leader induces pressure in the form of negative
feedback. This methodology has shortcomings because of the need of a constant
participation from the test leader during the whole procedure, which makes it
highly time demanding and therefore difficult to implement.

To overcome these disadvantages and improve the flexibility and
user-friendliness of the MIST protocol, Stress+ is proposed as an alternative.
It is a web application inspired by the MIST software which aims to provide new
ways to generate social stress without the need of a continuous involvement from
the test leader and also simplifies the research process. To achieve this, the
application has different components besides the well-known arithmetic test, and
also offers an organized and comprehensive user interface to simplify the
process of test creation.

** Overview :ignore:
In this paper, a usability and user experience study of Stress+ focused on the
test creator is presented. The objective is to evaluate the current prototype
and establish a baseline upon which the product can be improved by identifying
the points the users found less intuitive, attractive or useful.

** Usability study overview :ignore:
*** COMMENT Introduction
After designing a prototype, it is of paramount importance to perform a
usability test to continue with the design process. This is an essential step
for any product that is intended to be used by any third-party user.

"Usability is a quality attribute that assesses how easy user interfaces are to
use. The word ‘usability’ also refers to methods for improving ease-of-use
during the design process." cite:experience_usability_nodate.

It is defined by 5 quality components:
 - Learnability
 - Efficiency
 - Memorability
 - Errors
 - Satisfaction

Improving usability can increase productivity of users, reduce costs, increase
sales and revenue, enhance customer loyalty and attract new customers.

*** COMMENT Tools to evaluate usability
There are different tools to evaluate usability. Three of the most known methods
are:
 - AttrakDiff: It evaluates the usability and design of a product.
 - SUS
 - Nasa TLX

* Methods
** COMMENT What?
Who, what, when, where, how, why
 - Give a clear overview
 - Give enough info to replicate the study
 - Be complete, but help the reader:
   - Break into smaller sections
   - Cite references
   - Use flow diagrams
 - Use jargon and passive voice if needed

Report methods in past tense, ut present to explain how data is summarized

** Participants
The study included five participants with the unique criteria of having some
degree of familiarity doing research following the MIST protocol.

** Materials

The basic requirements to participate in the study were: access to internet
connection and a modern web browser (Firefox, Chrome). The software Zoom cite:noauthor_zoom_nodate was used for the online session and
remote screen-sharing technology.

The AttrakDiff \textsuperscript{TM} questionnaire
cite:noauthor_AttrakDiff_nodate was implemented to obtain a quantitative measurement of
the user experience and usability. To provide the questionnaire to the
participants and organize the results, the infrastructure offered after
registering in the AttrakDiff web page was used cite:noauthor_esurvey_nodate.
The theoretical basis of the study is detailed in the subsection ref:sec:AttrakDiff.

The web application Stress+, available at [[https://stress-plus.herokuapp.com/]] was
the target of the study. This link was provided at the beginning of the meeting
to all the participants. It is described in more detail in the subsection
ref:sec:stresspluss

** Procedure
    # 5. The facilitator will take note of the user's actions and the time for
    # each task.
    1. Participants received an email with guidelines about the test, including
       the tasks to perform.
    2. Participants took part in the usability test via remote screen-sharing
       technology using Zoom.
    3. The study facilitator gave an overview of the test to the participant.
    4. The study participant followed two tasks sequentially (the details are included
       in the appendix in ref:sec:protocol:
       - Create a stress test pipeline with specific parameters
       - Save the test pipeline of the first task, retrieve it after closing the
         application and send the link to the facilitator
    5. After the tasks, the participant completed an online usability
       questionnaire.
    6. There was an open space for discussions and suggestions.

** Stress+ pages to evaluate
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:stresspluss
:END:

The usability study focused on two of the pages of the application: the
management page and the editor. Both of them are used only by the researcher.

The management page appears after selecting the button "Go to management page"
in the home page. It shows all previously saved stress tests. It is possible to
open a test by clicking on it. Clicking on the thrash button deletes that
particular item. Following the "New" button To create a new stress test, opens
the Editor with an empty test. A screenshot is shown in figure ref:mgmt-page

The editor page is the place where the test is created. The name of the test can
be assigned using the text field on top. The available screens and overlays are
organized in the respective toolbars. The user creates a pipeline using drag and
drop. After that, each of the item's settings can be modified. The stress test
can be saved with the button "Save settings" at the bottom. A screenshot can be
found in figure ref:editor-fig.

** AttrakDiff
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:AttrakDiff
:END:

AttrakDiff is built upon Hassenzahl’s model for user experience
cite:inbook_userProduct, illustrated in figure ref:figure-ux. He assumes that a
product has features that are manipulated by the designer to convey an intended
product character.

Each person who uses the product constructs a personal version of the product
character, consisting of pragmatic and hedonic qualities. This appears as
consequences, such as judgment about the product's appeal, emotional(pleasure)
and behavioral(satisfaction) consequences.

The AttrakDiff study evaluates the product character in its two groups of
attributes: pragmatic and hedonic. A product is perceived as pragmatic when it
provides effective and efficient ways to manipulate the environment. This is
strongly related to the utility and usability. A product is perceived as hedonic
if it provides stimulation, identification or provokes memories cite:article.

An illustrative example is the task of driving a nail. A pragmatic perspective
would be using a hammer, which does the job without much effort. From a hedonic
point of view someone might buy a certain brand to show professionalism, or
other would buy a complete set of tools to build a hammer because it is more
satisfactory than just using one cite:inbook_userProduct.

To assess the perceived product character, AttrakDiff measures the
attractiveness of the prototype in the format of semantic differentials,
consisting of 28 seven-step items, paired as opposite adjectives and ordered in
a scale of intensity from -3 to 3 cite:noauthor_AttrakDiff_nodate. It has been
shown that hedonic and pragmatic qualities are consistent and independent, and
both contribute to the attractiveness rating cite:article.

The ultimate goal for a product character is to have an uncompromising
combination of strong pragmatic and hedonic attributes. But most likely, both
are not in balance, which leads either to a primarily pragmatic product
(task-oriented) or primarily hedonic product (self-oriented)
cite:inbook_userProduct. This fact is explored in figure ref:figure-grid.

* Results

** AttrakDiff
We obtained the following results, shown in the grid view that maps hedonic
quality and pragmatic quality in figure ref:figure-grid. This indicates that the
product is slightly task oriented, but given the confidence region, it is close
to the desired combination of hedonic and pragmatic quality.

[[file:AttrakDiff/Portfolio of results.png]]

Figure ref:figure-word-pairs shows the average the scale of intensity of each of
the 28 word pairs. According to it, the most important words for the pragmatic
quality are *simple* and *practical*, *presentable* for the identity hedonic
quality, *innovative* and *novel* for the stimulation hedonic quality and *good*
for the attractiveness.

The diagram of average values shown in figure ref:figure-avg-vals shows the
averages for each quality. All the scores are above zero, which means in all
cases they evoke positive emotions. It also shows that Stress+ performs better
in the pragmatic quality than in the hedonic quality.

** Performance of the participants
All the participants were able to follow the instructions and finish the task
successfully with a short explanation about the application.

Based on the observations of the performance of the participants during the
tasks assigned in the study session, these are some of the most important points
to improve:
- The difference between a generic ~Message~ screen and the ~End~ screen or
  ~Start~ screen was not intuitive at the beginning for some of the
  participants.
- The ~chatbot~ settings interface is not intuitive. It was not clear to the
  participants that the test expects a reply from the user in between each
  custom message.
- It could be useful to add auto save functionality: one of the participants
  accidentally closed the screen without saving for some time and most of the
  settings were deleted.

The feedback received for improvement is summarized in the following points:
- Order the saved tests in the management page by creation date, with the newest
  at the top.
- The dark blue color for the buttons make them more prominent than they should
  be.
- Reduce the size of the settings button.
- Chatbot functionality is still not realistic enough to be effectively used in
  a real stress test.

** Answer to hypothesis :ignore:
The current prototype has a good performance in terms of the user experience and
usability, based on the quantitative results obtained from the AttrakDiff test
and the comments received during the sessions.

\\

** Support of answer :ignore:
Based on figure ref:figure-grid, it is possible to conclude that the product is
near the desired value combination for hedonic and pragmatic qualities . This
means the product is useful and at the same time likeable. The slightly higher
choice of a stronger pragmatic qualities by the participants can be explained by
the nature of the interface, being more technical in principle, mainly focused
on the creation and modification of a stress test.

The results in figure ref:figure-grid lead to the conclusion that the feeling of
interactivity with the application (hedonic interactive quality) was the lowest
of the evaluated qualities, in part influenced by its technical nature, even if
the drag and drop feature should have improved this aspect.To be more specific,
the majority of low scores in the word pairs belong to the hedonic interactive
quality, as observed in figure ref:figure-word-pairs. Words such as *isolating*,
*alienating* and *separates me* were preferred over *connecting*, *integrating*
and *brings me closer* respectively. One way to improve the interaction would be
to provide a wizard that guides the user through the test creation and some
settings modifications. Nevertheless, given that the Editor page is purely
technical-oriented, it is not necessarily negative that it evokes these feelings
in the participants.

The use of AttrakDiff facilitates the comparison with future iterations of the
application, which is even a built-in option of the methodology. Another reason
to choose it over other tools such as SUS (System Usability Scale) is explained
by its holistic view which not only includes usability evaluation in the form of
pragmatic qualities, but also emotional aspect as hedonic qualities in a single
questionnaire. The test is also intuitive and provides little burden for the
participants. It is also easy to put in practice in a remote study such as this
case. Besides, its results have a clear and fast interpretation.

The feedback given by the participants was mainly in the direction that Stress+
is a considerable improvement in comparison to the MIST software they have used
before. It was also easy for them to get started using the ~Editor~ page and
therefore they could focus on more specific details of the user interface during
the study.

* Summary and outlook

Stress+ is a web application that builds upon the MIST as a tool to help
researchers study in the laboratory how stress is related to illness. It
achieves that by providing more features and enhancing the user experience of
the researchers with the application. After performing a user experience study
with the help of the AttrakDiff system, we discovered that Stress+ is already
addressing some of the pain points of the previous protocols have, and also know
in which direction to apply changes to improve how the users interact with it.

The next step is to apply changes to address the comments from the participants
and the shortcomings observed after they performed their tasks and then use the
same analysis tools to evaluate the user experience and usability of the new
iteration of the prototype. By using the results obtained in this first study as
a baseline, it would be possible to judge whether the changes are in the right
direction and where they impact the most.
