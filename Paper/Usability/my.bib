  abstract        = {OBJECTIVE: We developed a protocol for inducing moderate
                  psychologic stress in a functional imaging setting and
                  evaluated the effects of stress on physiology and brain
                  activation. METHODS: The Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST),
                  derived from the Trier Mental Challenge Test, consists of a
                  series of computerized mental arithmetic challenges, along
                  with social evaluative threat components that are built into
                  the program or presented by the investigator. To allow the
                  effects of stress and mental arithmetic to be investigated
                  separately, the MIST has 3 test conditions (rest, control and
                  experimental), which can be presented in either a block or an
                  event-related design, for use with functional magnetic
                  resonance imaging (fMRI) or positron emission tomography
                  (PET). In the rest condition, subjects look at a static
                  computer screen on which no tasks are shown. In the control
                  condition, a series of mental arithmetic tasks are displayed
                  on the computer screen, and subjects submit their answers by
                  means of a response interface. In the experimental condition,
                  the difficulty and time limit of the tasks are manipulated to
                  be just beyond the individual's mental capacity. In addition,
                  in this condition the presentation of the mental arithmetic
                  tasks is supplemented by a display of information on
                  individual and average performance, as well as expected
                  performance. Upon completion of each task, the program
                  presents a performance evaluation to further increase the
                  social evaluative threat of the situation. RESULTS: In 2
                  independent studies using PET and a third independent study
                  using fMRI, with a total of 42 subjects, levels of salivary
                  free cortisol for the whole group were significantly increased
                  under the experimental condition, relative to the control and
                  rest conditions. Performing mental arithmetic was linked to
                  activation of motor and visual association cortices, as well
                  as brain structures involved in the performance of these tasks
                  (e.g., the angular gyrus). CONCLUSIONS: We propose the MIST as
                  a tool for investigating the effects of perceiving and
                  processing psychosocial stress in functional imaging studies.},

  abstract        = {Abstract: Adaptation in the face of potentially stressful
                  challenges involves activation of neural, neuroendocrine and
                  neuroendocrine-immune mechanisms. This has been called
                  “allostasis” or “stability through change” by Sterling and
                  Eyer (Fisher S., Reason J. (eds): Handbook of Life Stress,
                  Cognition and Health. J. Wiley Ltd. 1988, p. 631), and
                  allostasis is an essential component of maintaining
                  homeostasis. When these adaptive systems are turned on and
                  turned off again efficiently and not too frequently, the body
                  is able to cope effectively with challenges that it might not
                  otherwise survive. However, there are a number of
                  circumstances in which allostatic systems may either be
                  overstimulated or not perform normally, and this condition has
                  been termed “allostatic load” or the price of adaptation
                  (McEwen and Stellar, Arch. Int. Med. 1993; 153:2093.).
                  Allostatic load can lead to disease over long periods. Types
                  of allostatic load include (1) frequent activation of
                  allostatic systems; (2) failure to shut off allostatic
                  activity after stress; (3) inadequate response of allostatic
                  systems leading to elevated activity of other, normally
                  counter-regulated allostatic systems after stress. Examples
                  will be given for each type of allostatic load from research
                  pertaining to autonomic, CNS, neuroendocrine, and immune
                  system activity. The relationship of allostatic load to
                  genetic and developmental predispositions to disease is also
                  considered.},
