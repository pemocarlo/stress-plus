\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

This project aims to develop a tool called \textit{Stress+} that simplifies the existing stress test process. 
Stress is one of the major problems, it often gets overlooked and plays a negative influence on the overall quality of life. 
Due to its significant public health concern, the demand for a stress test is increasing rapidly. 
The basic idea behind this project is to overcome the limitations of existing stress test which requires a lot of time, assistance, and effort. 
\textit{Stress+} is a user-friendly tool that allows the participants to take the stress test with their own devices, anytime, anywhere. 
Based on the Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST), this app sets up a challenging environment that induces the psychological stress level of the participants by allowing them to take a mental arithmetic test which is supported by stress-inducing factors like time constraints, scores, feedback etc. 
The results are shared to doctors which aids them to diagnose and plan any further treatment.
The \textit{Stress+} application is also designed for doctors, physiotherapist, sports psychologist, stress counsellors and health insurance organizations to assist their process.
