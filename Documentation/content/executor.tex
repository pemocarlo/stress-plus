\section{Executor}
\label{sec:executor}

The executor is responsible for handling the execution of a stress test.
The id of the stress test to be executed is contained in the link generated by the editor.
With this id, the executor loads the stress test configuration from the backend and starts displaying the screens and overlays.

The executor is also responsible for collecting and saving all records for the statistics.
The records are batched together for each screen.
They are all sent together to the backend when the screen changes to the next one.
Therefore, records for the end screen will not be sent and saved in the database.

Currently, there are three types of records.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The math test screen will add records for each answer of the participant.
    \item The chatbot screen will add a record containing the messages from the participant.
    \item The mouse cursor position will be added to the records once per second.
\end{itemize}
