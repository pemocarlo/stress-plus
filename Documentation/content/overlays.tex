\section{Overlays}
\label{sec:overlays}

For easy positioning of the overlays, an overlay can have the optional property \texttt{position} which controls the position of the overlay on the screen.

Overlays must be registered in the overlay registry to be available.
Following properties must be specified when registering an overlay:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The unique name of the overlay
  \item The React component for displaying the overlay while executing
  \item The React component for displaying the settings of the overlay inside the editor
  \item The initial settings of the overlay
\end{itemize}

When an overlay is displayed during the stress test execution, its React component will receive its settings inside the props.
