\section{Architecture}
\label{sec:architecture}

This chapter describes the architecture of Stress+.
The whole architecture was designed in a way that arbitrary stress tests can be created with the given modules and new modules can be programmed and added very easily.
Each stress test consist of a pipeline of screens which are show to the patient successively in the specified order.
Additionally a stress test can contain overlays which are displayed on top of the screens.

The figure \ref{fig:software-architecture} shows the software architecture of Stress+, which developed as a browser based application and consists of a frontend and a backend.
The main frontend components of Stress+ are the \textit{Editor} for creating and editing stress tests and the \textit{Executor} for executing a stress test.
On the \textit{Management page} all available stress tests can be managed.
To be able to easily add new modules in the future all availalbe screens and overlays are registered in the \textit{Screen registry} and \textit{Overlay registry}. 
Therefore the \textit{Editor} and \textit{Executor} are developed in a generic way and must query the registries to know which modules are currently present.
After saving a stress test in the \textit{Editor} a link is generated, which can be send to the patient so he can execute the stress test.

The backend is responsible for saving the stress test configurations and the statistics on how the patient performed.
Therefore it consists of a REST API, through which the database can be accessed.

\subsection{Frontend}
The frontend is a Single-page application written in JavaScript with the React framework. 
The following sections describe the different frontend components in more detail

\subsubsection*{Screen}
The stress test consists of a list of screens that will be displayed successively to the patient. 
A screen will be displayed fullscreen inside the uses browsers. 
Each screen has its own settings, which can be adjusted inside the editor. 
All available screens can be found in the chapter \ref{sec:screens}.

\subsubsection*{Overlay}
The stress test can be equipped with overlays that are displayed on top of the current screen. 
All overlays are displayed simultaneously during the whole stress pipeline execution, therefore they do not have an order. 
Each overlay has its own settings, which can be adjusted inside the editor.
All available overlays can be found in the chapter \ref{sec:overlays}.

\subsubsection*{Management page}
On the management page all availalbe stress test are displayed.
From there you can open a stress test in the editor, delete one or create a new test.
Further details can be found in the chapter \ref{sec:management-page}.

\subsubsection*{Editor}
The stress tests can be created and edited in the editor.
Also every setting of the screens and overlays can be adjusted within the editor.
Each stress test has a unique ID that is generated when it is saved for the first time.
With this ID a link is generated that can be send to patients so they can execute the stress test.
From the editor users can also download all recorded statistics for the current stress test.
Further details can be found in the chapter \ref{sec:editor}.

\subsubsection*{Executor}
The executor extracts the unique stress test id from the link and loads the stress test configuration from the backend.
Then the executor will display each screen successively to the patient. 
All Overlays are displayed simultaneously during the whole stress test run.
The executor is also responsible to collect records from the screens and persist them in the database.
Further details can be found in the chapter \ref{sec:executor}.

\subsection{Backend}
The backend consists of the Database and the REST API

\subsubsection*{Database}
To save the stress test configurations and the results of stress test executions a database is used.
Because the data does not have a clear structure, as arbitrary modules can be composed in a stress test, a relational database is not suitable.
Instead the document-oriented NO-SQL database MongoDB is used.

\subsubsection*{REST API}
The REST API acts as the connection between the frontend and the database.
The REST API can be accessed via HTTP and uses JSON documents for transfering the data.
The REST API is written in JavaScript on the NodeJS platform and uses the express HTTP framework.
