The easiest way to deploy Stress+ is using a Docker container.
To build the docker image a \texttt{Dockerfile} is present in the root directory. 
The \texttt{Dockerfile} will build the frontend and configure the backend to also serve the frontend. 
Run the following command in the root directory of this repository to build the docker image with the name \texttt{stress-plus}.
\begin{verbatim}
    docker build -t stress-plus .
\end{verbatim}
After the docker image is built it can be started with:
\begin{verbatim}
    docker run 
      --detach 
      --name stress-plus 
      --publish 80:80 
      --env MONGODB_URI=<mongodb-uri> 
      stress-plus
\end{verbatim}
Stress+ is now running on port $80$ of the host machine.
By default the backend will listen on port $80$ of the container, but this can be changed by setting the \texttt{PORT} environment variable.
The backend requires a running MongoDB database, therefore you must set the \texttt{MONGODB\_URI} environment variable. 
The value should have the following schema:
\begin{verbatim}
    mongodb://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database-name>
\end{verbatim}
